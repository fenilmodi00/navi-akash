# Merge Conflict Resolution

We've resolved one of the merge conflicts in `src/agent.ts`, but there's still a conflict in `bun.lock`. Here are the steps to complete the merge process:

## Resolving the bun.lock conflict

The bun.lock file has conflicts between the branches. Since this is a lock file, the simplest approach is to:

1. Accept the changes from web-int branch (which has more complete dependencies)
2. Run `bun install` to regenerate the lock file correctly

To resolve the conflict in bun.lock:

```bash
# Option 1: Accept the web-int version
git checkout web-int -- bun.lock

# Option 2: Or delete it and regenerate
rm bun.lock
bun install
```

## Completing the Merge

After resolving the conflicts, complete the merge:

```bash
# Add the resolved files
git add src/agent.ts bun.lock

# Commit the merge
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts between main and web-int branches"

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

## Verifying the Merge

After completing the merge, verify that the application works correctly:

1. Build all plugins:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. Verify that all functionality works correctly, especially the features from both branches.

## Notes on the Resolved Conflicts

1. **In src/agent.ts**:
   - We kept the web-int branch improvements including the web search functionality
   - We preserved the shouldUseWebSearch function
   - We maintained the structure and configuration for all plugins

2. **In bun.lock**:
   - The web-int branch has more complete dependencies including knowledge plugin and web search plugin
   - It's best to use the newer dependency structure from web-int
